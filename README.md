# LLMs for querying documents and searching the web

A codebase containing different LLM projects implemented using LangChain and Streamlit. 

1. DinnerPlanner: A simple LLM application backed by Google Gemini Pro that allows the user to obtain 1-3 recipe ideas using a list of ingredients.
2. ChatDocuments: A highly-customizable conversational LLM chatbot that can answer queries about a number of documents uploaded by the user. It supports multiple LLMs/vector stores/embedding models/document types.
3. Agent: A conversational MRKL agent backed by Google Gemini Pro that can answer general queries by interfacing with DuckDuckGo and mathematical queries when needed.

These implementations have been inspired by the following repositories: 
* [langchain_ai/streamlit-agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/streamlit-agent/tree/main/streamlit_agent)
* [alejandro-ao/langchain-chat-gui](https://github.com/alejandro-ao/langchain-chat-gui)
